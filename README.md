A brochure website I developed in 2018 for a newly constructed over 55 housing community in Campion, Colorado.

Developed using React and the Bulma CSS framework (https://bulma.io/)

Integrated with Google and Facebook analytics (both currently disarmed)

Can be found hosted here on GitHub pages https://jteration.github.io/horizon-hills/
